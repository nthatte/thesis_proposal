    prosthesis includes series elastic actuators to enable accurate torque

    angle torque.}\label{fig:prosthesis_render_annotated}
\end{marginfigure} 

To test our proposed Neuromuscular control approach, and its ability to help
subjects maintain or recover their balance, we build a custom transemoral
prosthesis capable of reproducing dynamic locomotion tasks. The proposed design,
shown in \cref{fig:prosthesis_render_annotated}, uses brushless electric motors
coupled to harmonic drive gear sets to drive both the knee and ankle joints.
Additionally, the joints employ series elastic actuation to enable accurate
torque control and to protect the Harmonic Drive gear sets from sudden impacts.
The design also features a unidirectional parallel spring in the ankle that
partly offsets the torque demands on the ankle motor.  We design both joints to
meet the demands of dynamic locomotion tasks such as running and trip recovery.

The overall design concept sits in a niche between low powered prostheses
designed with commercial applicability in mind
\citep{sup2007design,sup2009preliminary,lawson2014robotic,rouse2015design,
martinez2011antagonistic} which feature onboard actuation and power sources, and
high-powered tethered systems \citep{caputo2013experimental,
caputo2015informing} with off board actuation designed exclusively for use in
lab environment. Our design features onboard actuators that are more powerful
than those used in standalone devices, but less capable than those employed in
tethered devices. To ensure a reasonable overall weight the device's batteries,
motor drivers, and computers are off board. With this design, we expect to be
able to test control ideas without encountering hardware performance limitations
as with a tethered device. At the same time the device is capable of functioning
outside of the lab environment like a standalone prosthesis.

\end{table}

\Cref{tab:pros_requirements} shows the desired design specifications for the
transfemoral prosthesis and the values achieved by the final design. To obtain
these design specifications we examined a number of studies that elicited trip
responses.

We specify desired joint torque and speed values to meet the requirements of
demanding tasks such as running. The maximum knee torque specification comes
from the findings of \citet{whitley2008maximum}, who tested the joint torques
used during recovery from a simulated fall. The maximum knee speed requirement
comes from \citet{grabiner1993kinematics}, who tested subjects' responses to
simulated trips induced by unseen obstacles on a walkway. We obtain the maximum
ankle torque requirement from \citet{pijnappels2005early}, who tripped subjects
using a obstacles that could suddenly emerge through the floor. The maximum
ankle speed requirement comes from the running data of
\citet{novacheck1998biomechanics}. We set to the minimum height specification,
measured between the center of the knee and bottom of the foot, to accommodate
the $10^\tn{th}$ percentile female \citep{gordon1988anthropometric}.  Finally,
the required weight corresponds to the mean leg weight of a $50^\tn{th}$
percentile male \citep{winter2009biomechanics}.

\subsection{Knee Joint}
\begin{comment}
\begin{marginfigure}[0in]
    \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{knee_running_torque}
    \caption{Knee torque required for running}\label{fig:knee_running_torque}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{marginfigure}[0in]
    \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{knee_running_speed}
    \caption{Knee torque required for running}\label{fig:knee_running_speed}
\end{marginfigure}
\end{comment}

In addition to achieving the maximum speeds and torques found in
\cref{tab:pros_requirements}, we design the knee joint so that it can reproduce
the torque and speed required for a \unit[80]{kg} person to run at
\unitfrac[3.2]{m}{s} as measured by \citet{novacheck1998biomechanics}. To
reproduce this trajectory in the knee joint, we utilize a RoboDrive ILM
$85\times13$ HS-SP motor coupled to a Harmonic Drive Gear set with a 50:1
reduction (CSG--25--50). \Cref{fig:knee_motor_torque} shows the motor torque
and speed required to reproduce a running trajectory assuming a gear
efficiency of $75\%$. In this plot, we see that the running trajectory lies
within the speed-dependent torque limit of the motor. Moreover, the root mean
squared torque of this trajectory $(\unit[1.46]{N \cdot m})$ exceeds the torque
rating of the motor $(\unit[1.43]{N \cdot m})$ by just $2\%$. Therefore, the
knee joint should be able to provide the necessary torque to enable running for
a short amount of time, or continuously for lighter subjects or at a slightly
reduced speed.

    running}\label{fig:knee_motor_torque}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{knee_design}
    \caption{Internal and external design of the knee 
    joint.}\label{fig:knee_design}
\end{figure*}
\Cref{fig:knee_design} shows the internal and external design of the knee joint.
The primary component in the knee joint is the stator housing. On top of the
housing is a standard pyramid adaptor that allows the prosthesis to connect to
amputee's sockets. Within the stator housing, lies the brushless motor stator,
rotor, and harmonic drive gear set. We sense absolute rotor angle for
commutation of the brushless motor via hall effect sensors and a magnetic
complementary sin/cos encoder. To incorporate series elasticity, we take
inspiration from the design of the bipedal robot Atrias
\citep{grimes2013atrias}, which uses fiberglass series leaf springs. In our
design, the output of the gear set drives the proximal end of a fiberglass leaf
spring in series with the shank. Two Renishaw Resolute absolute encoders measure
the deflection of this spring to enable torque control.

In addition to allowing for accurate torque control, as shown by
\citet{au2007biomechanical,au2008powered}, the series elasticity also plays a
crucial role in protecting fragile gear components from impact loads. To choose
the spring stiffness for the knee joint, we simulate the prosthesis impacting a
rigid wall with the foot during swing. To do this, we construct a model of the
prosthesis in Matlab Simulink Simulink Simscape Multibody that includes the
series elasticity, gear dynamics, and motor electrical dynamics (for
details see \cref{sec:sec_simulation_environ}). \Cref{fig:impact_sim_knee} shows
the simulation environment. The prosthesis is attached to the distal end of a
thigh segment with a fixed hip position. We control the hip via the ideal swing
leg control outlined in \cref{sec:neuro_ideal_swing} (\cref{eq:hipfeedback}) and
consider the case where the external voltage applied to the motor is zero. This
simulation suggests that a spring stiffness under $\unitfrac[2300]{N \cdot
m}{rad}$ will ensure that the peak impact torque remains lower than the peak
allowable impact torque of the Harmonic Drive of $\unit[242]{N \cdot m}$.

    \caption{Impact simulation we used to determine appropriate series spring
    stiffness.}\label{fig:knee_impact sim}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Ankle Joint}

In the ankle joint we utilize a RoboDrive ILM $70\times10$ HS-SP motor coupled
to a Harmonic Drive Gear set with a 100:1 reduction (CSG--20--100). As with the
knee joint, we design the ankle joint to satisfy the requirements listed in
\cref{tab:pros_requirements}. Specifically, for the ankle joint we pay
considerable attention to the tripping condition described by
\citet{pijnappels2005early}, in which the ankle generates a peak torque of
$\unit[202]{N \cdot m}$. 

\begin{marginfigure}[-0in]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ankle_torque_vs_angle_ups}
    \caption{Ankle torque vs angle curve during steady, level-ground walking
    (blue) (\citet{winter2009biomechanics} scaled to \unit[80]{kg} person). A
    unidirectional parallel spring can provide a portion of this torque (green)
    and reduces the required actuator torque (purple) to lie under repeated
    torque limit of the Harmonic Drive Gear set (orange).
    }\label{fig:ankle_torque_vs_angle_ups}
\end{marginfigure}
To avoid using a large and heavy motor to achieve this peak torque, we take
inspiration from previous prosthetic ankle designs that employ a unidirectional
parallel spring in the ankle joint that performs the conservative portion of the
ankle's torque versus angle trajectory during normal walking
\citep{au2007biomechanical,au2008powered,sup2009preliminary,lawson2014robotic}.
The parallel spring offsets the required motor torque, as the actuator only
needs to provide the difference between the desired torque and the torque
provided by the parallel spring. \Cref{fig:ankle_torque_vs_angle_ups} shows the
torque versus angle curve during level ground walking
(\citet{winter2009biomechanics}, scaled to \unit[80]{kg} person). In green we
show the torque generated by a $\unitfrac[700]{N \cdot m}{rad}$ parallel spring
optimized to minimize the root-mean-squared motor torque for this trajectory.
From this plot, we see that with the parallel spring, the peak torque is lower
than the repeated peak torque limit of the Harmonic Drive Gear set.
\begin{figure}[b]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[height=2in]{ankle_motor_torque_tripping}
    \caption{Ankle motor torque required to take the trip recovery action
    observed by \citet{pijnappels2005early} (blue, trajectory obtained by scaling
    walking data from \citet{winter2009biomechanics} to a peak torque of
    $\unit[202]{N \cdot m}$, $75\%$ gear efficiency assumed). Using a parallel
    spring allows the motor to produce the required torque while remaining
    within it's torque limit.
    }\label{fig:ankle_motor_torque_tripping}
\end{figure}

The tripping data obtained by \citet{pijnappels2005early} shows that the ankle
kinematics during trip recovery are similar to those seen during normal walking.
Therefore, the parallel spring, should be able to contribute torque during the
tripping case as well. To confirm this, \cref{fig:ankle_motor_torque_tripping}
shows the motor torque required for trip recovery (obtained by scaling walking
torque data from \citet{winter2009biomechanics} to have a peak torque of
$\unit[202]{N \cdot m})$ We see that the inclusion of the parallel spring allows
the prosthesis to produce enough net torque to reproduce the trip recovery
trajectory without exceeding the torque limit of the motor. 

Finally, \cref{fig:ankle_motor_torque_running} shows the torque and speed
required of the motor for running \citep{novacheck1998biomechanics}. In this
case, we use an ankle parallel stiffness of $\unitfrac[267]{N \cdot m}{rad}$.
From this plot, we see that this combination of ankle motor and spring is nearly
sufficient for running. Increasing the voltage of the prosthesis from
\unit[48]{V} to \unit[60]{V} or decreasing the gear ratio from 100:1 to 80:1
will allow the torque trajectory to fit completely within the motor limits.

actuator design. \Cref{fig:ankle_design} shows internal and external views of
the ankle actuator.
